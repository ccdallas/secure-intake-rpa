# Secure Intake Automation RPA

**Automating secure, high-risk intake workflows for emergency patients and injured athletes.**

## About This Project
As a former emergency medicine professional turned cybersecurity specialist, I created this RPA project to showcase how secure automation can streamline intake processes in both healthcare and sports settings—while prioritizing data privacy and operational accuracy.

This proof-of-concept bot reads intake forms, logs essential data into a mock system, and masks sensitive information unless authorization is verified—all while reducing human error and expediting care or coaching decisions.

---

## Technologies Used
- UiPath Community Edition
- CSV files as mock intake data
- Secure logging (CSV / Python scripting)
- Optional: Microsoft Power Automate or Python-based RPA for code-first learners

---

## Use Cases
- **ER Intake**: Accelerate patient triage while securing PHI
- **Athlete Injury Intake**: Collect data quickly from wearable logs or training reports
- **Cybersecurity Focus**: Mask PII/PHI, maintain audit logs, handle malformed or incomplete data safely

---

## Folder Overview
- `/forms` – Sample intake forms (ER & Athlete)
- `/workflow` – Main RPA bot file
- `/logs` – Secure logs showing authorized access
- `/scripts` – Optional Python module for masking or logging
- `/docs` – Future screenshots or process flow diagrams

---

## What’s Next?
- Expand this bot to integrate with FHIR or wearable APIs
- Add a role-based access system for secure data review
- Use RPA to generate follow-up reports for clinicians and coaches
